This web-application is a video integration web-site that connects doctors and patients, without insurance, and allows patients to virtually visit with medical professionals, without insurance.  This was a group project, that was created during my time at Wyncode Academy.  We utilized Ruby on Rails and Javascript, and incorporated the BCRYPT gem, STRIPE API, and TOKBOX.
